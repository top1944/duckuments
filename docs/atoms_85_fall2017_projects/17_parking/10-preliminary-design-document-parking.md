## Part 1: Mission and scope

### Mission statement

Implement parking feature and design specifications (feature and physical)

### Motto

<!-- Duck Ex Machina -->

TODO: What is the translation?

#### Stakeholders

* Single SLAM or distributed-est
* Controls
* Smart City
* Anti Instagram


## Part 2: Definition of the problem

### Problem statement

We need to park N Duckiebots in a designated area in which they are able enter and exit in an efficient manner.

### Assumptions

* Four tile structure with defined inlet, outlet and color scheme
* Known design specification of parking lot
* Assume when leaving parking space, path is free of other Duckiebots
* When entering lot and searching for parking space, parking lot is in static state


### Approach

* Enter parking lot in designated inlet lane
* Localize based on april tags within field of view with known locations
* Control with feedback along predetermined path
* Detect parking space status (full/free) of each parking space in sequential manner
* Locate a free parking space
* Paths generated for maneuvering into parking space
* High fidelity control into parking space
* Signal generated to signify parking space is full
* When we want to leave a space, generate path out of parking space
* High fidelity control out of parking space (with caster wheel dynamics taken into account for feedback control)
* Control with feedback along predetermined path
* Exit parking lot in designated outlet lane


### Functionality-resources trade-offs



### Functionality provided

* Probability of a successful parking maneuver per parking maneuver attempt
* Number of Duckiebots within the parking lot boundary per hour


### Resources required / dependencies / costs

* Size of parking space
* Resources required to develop Duckiebot trajectory
* Number of april tags and infrastructure to support april tags

### Performance measurement

* Starting at parking lot entrance, measure the number of parking maneuvers completed within boundaries of designated parking spot (over N attempts)
* Starting in designated parking space, measure the number of Duckiebots able to arrive at the exit of the parking lot (over N attempts)
* Average time (for N vehicles) to enter and exit parking lot

## Part 3: Preliminary design

### Modules

#### Perception

* Lane filtering
* April tag detection
* “Fleet communication”: detecting

#### Localization and parking map generation

* Ego localization
* Localization other Duckiebots
* Parking map design


#### Planning


* Parking space allocation
* Path planning


#### Control


* “Fleet communication”: publishing


### Interfaces

#### Perception

##### Lane filtering

* Used for pose estimation at entrance and exit of parking lot and maybe at parking space
* Input: camera image
* Output: location lanes

##### April tags detection and triangulation

* Use for pose estimation while driving on the parking lot when no lanes can be identified, every parking space has its own april tag, relative Duckiebot-tag pose is extracted using computer vision
* Input: camera image
* Output: location of april tag, relative position Duckiebot-tag

##### “Fleet communication”: detecting

* Blinking LEDs are used for communication: while parking signal who is driving (one at the time), while parked signal which parking lot is taken (Duckiebot on parking space 2, blink led in parking space 2 specific frequency)
* Input: camera image
* Output: other occupied signals (other means blinking signals is not from own Duckiebot)

#### Localization and parking map generation

##### Localization other Duckiebots

* Determines the pose of other Duckiebots using specific blinking LEDs
* Input: other occupied signal(s)
* Output: pose other Duckiebot(s)

##### Parking map design

* Static map (physical known map with defined parking spaces and areas to move to them, without Duckiebots) is merged with pose of other Duckiebots to generate a {occupied, free} map of the parking lot
* Input: static map (has to be defined offline), pose other Duckiebots
* Output: parking map

##### Ego localization

* State estimation of position (x, y) and heading (theta) of own Duckiebot using lanes (at entrance/exit of parking lot) and april tags
* Input: parking map, relative position Duckiebot-tag(s), localization april tag(s), location lane(s)
* Output: pose Duckiebot

#### Path planning

##### Parking space allocation

* Allocates a parking space to the Duckiebot given the parking map and the authority to move, executed once per Duckiebot
* Input: parking map, pose Duckiebot
* Output: pose parking space (x, y, theta)

##### Path planning

* The actual path planning module
* Input: pose parking space, pose Duckiebot, parking map
* Output: reference path or reference trajectory

#### Control

* High fidelity control algorithm to drive Duckiebot on reference trajectory/path to allocated parking space, flag when parked
* Input: reference path, pose Duckiebot, (maybe parking map → constrained control)
* Output: motor voltage, parking status = {going to parking space, parked, want to leave, exiting parking space}

#### “Fleet communication” publishing

* Flag status using specific frequency on LEDs (or color for human eye)
* Input: parking status
* Output: own_occupied_signal

### Preliminary plan of deliverables

* Need: infrastructure, localization algorithm using april tags (maybe fusion with lane detection), high fidelity control algorithm, map generation algorithm, localization (ego and other Duckiebots), parking space allocation, path planning algorithm
* Exists: Lane detection, color filters, lane control, LED communication, april tag detection, control algorithm (maybe has to be improved),


### Specifications

Yes, we need to add parking lot specifications.

### Software modules

A collection of ROS nodes.

### Infrastructure modules

Yes, we will include infrastructure modules to specify parking lot specifications.

## Part 4: Project planning


### Data collection

* April tag localization data
* April tag distance data (detection in a range of ~10 cm until ~1 m away from sign)
* Duckiebot to Duckiebot communication using flashing LEDs


### Data annotation

No

#### Relevant Duckietown resources to investigate

* April tag detection and localization (what is done already?)
* Control algorithm with good enough precision
* Transforming pose to configuration space
* Path planning algorithm (RRT*)
* Driving backwards (together with the control guys) while updating the pose of the Duckiebot


#### Other relevant resources to investigate

* Transforming pose to configuration space
* Path planning algorithm (RRT*)


### Risk analysis

* Localization fails while driving backwards
* Traffic jam at entrance of parking lot
* Fleet communication fails: incoming Duckiebot does not see currently parking Duckiebot, two Duckiebots leave at the same time
* Detection of april tags and extracting pose of the robot
* Map generation is wrong if Duckiebot is not parked to specification
* Control: level of precision adequate for parking
* Exit parking maneuver conflicts: who can drive first (Duckiebot which is exiting does probably not see anything)
