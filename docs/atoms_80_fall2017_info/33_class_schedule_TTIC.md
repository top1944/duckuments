**Please complete the onboarding questionnaire by Thursday, September 27, 5:00pm CT**


## Wednesday, September 27: Duckiebox Ceremony

Welcome to Duckietown! This lecture constitutes the _Duckiebox ceremony_ during which we will distribute your Duckieboxes and ask you to name your yet-to-be built Duckiebots! We will also discuss logistics related to the course, but we admit that that isn't as exciting.


### Lecture Content

* [The Duckiebook](http://book.duckietown.org/fall2017/duckiebook/index.html)
* Slack ([](#slack_channels))
* Git repos ([](#fall2017-git))
* How to get and give help ([](#help))
* [](#checkoff_assembly_configuration) initiated
* Getting to know one another
* Naming your robots
* Distribute the Duckieboxes!


As you name your Duckiebots, please consider the following constraints:

- The name must work as a hostname. It needs to start with a letter, contains only letters and numbers, and no spaces or punctuation.
- It should be short, easy to type. (You'll type it a lot.)
- It cannot be your own name.
- It cannot be a generic name like "robot", "duckiebot", "car". It cannot contain brand names.

## Monday, October 9: Modeling

### Preparation

**Important**: Before starting these tutorials, make sure that you completed the following:

See: [](#setup-laptop)

Before coming to class, please read through the following tutorials:

* [https://tinyurl.com/ROS101-Intro](https://tinyurl.com/ROS101-Intro)
* [http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials#Beginner_Level](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials#Beginner_Level)
Complete all the tutorials in Section 1.1 Beginner Level.
There is no need to install ROS as the tutorial instructs, because you already installed as part of the [setup process](#setup-laptop).
Sections 11 and 14 of this tutorial will ask you to implement simple ROS nodes using C++. You can skip them since Sections 12 and 15 are basically the same but using Python.
