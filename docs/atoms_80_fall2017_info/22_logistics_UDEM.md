## Storing Your Robot

It is preferable that you keep your robot for the semester. However, if you do not have a secure location where you can store it, we can store it for you in Room XXX in Pavillion André-Aisenstadt. However, you will have to ask Prof. Liam Paull to access or store your robot there each time since we cannot give out access to this space to the students in the class.
