# Checkoff: Duckiebot Assembly and Configuration {#checkoff_assembly_configuration status=ready}


The first job is to get your Duckiebot put together and up and running.

<!-- Comment: @liam: We should make sure that these tasks are 1-to-1 with the task list in the checkoff spreadsheet, and remind them what to do.

## Pick up your Duckiebox

Slack Channel: [#help-parts](https://duckietown.slack.com/archives/C6ZFZ7N2E)

There is a checklist inside. You should go through the box and ensure that the parts that are supposed to be in it actually are inside.

If you are missing something, contact your local responsible and ask for help on Slack in the appropriate channel.

These sections describe the parts that are in your box.

## Soldering your boards

Depending on how kind your instructors/TAs are, you may have to solder your boards.

You don't need to solder anything.

## Assemble your Robot

Slack Channel: [#help-assembly](https://duckietown.slack.com/archives/C70CQQFHC)

You are ready to put things together now.

## Optional: Reproduce the SD Card Image

If you are very inexperienced with Linux/Unix/networking etc, then you may find it a valuable experience to reproduce the SD card image to "see how the sausage is made".

See: [](#duckiebot-ubuntu-image)

You probably don't want to see how the sausage is made.

## Setup your laptop

Slack channel: [#help-laptops](https://duckietown.slack.com/archives/C6YS8UPRN)

The only officially supported OS is Ubuntu 16.04. If you are not running this OS it is recommended that you make a small partition on your hard drive and install the OS.

Related parts of the book are:

## Make your robot move

Slack Channel: [#help-robot-setup](https://duckietown.slack.com/archives/C6ZG100EN)

Now you need to clone the software repo and run things to make your robot move.

First initialize the robot:

See: [](#setup-duckiebot)

Then get it to move!

See: [](#rc-control)
