## Git setup

First, make sure you are in the Github Zurich team.

If your name is not [here](https://github.com/orgs/duckietown/teams/zurich/members),
contact Kirsten, and stop. You will not be able to do the next step.


Please clone this repository:

    git@github.com:AndreaCensi/exercises-fall2017.git

using

    $ git clone git@github.com:AndreaCensi/exercises-fall2017.git


This repository is writable by all Zurich people, but not readable by Chicago
and Montreal. Because they grade the homework, we need to keep it secret.

We invite everybody to just push their exercises to this repository.
(This is also compulsory to get help from TAs, so that the TAs can give comments
that are useful for everybody.)


## The exercises

We have created a series of exercises that are supposed to help somebody who
doesn't know how to program in Python/Linux to a decent level.

We suggest the following:

1. First, read through the exercises and note the skills that are learned for each one.

2. Look at the last two: "Log Instagram" and "Live Instagram". Do you think you can do them?
   If so, just do those two and feel free to skip the rest.

3. Otherwise, you have a lot to catch up. No problem. Take your time. Start with the basic
   exercise. TAs are here to help.
